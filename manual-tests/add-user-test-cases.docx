Feature: Add User functionality
  As an Admin
  I want to add new users to the system
  So that they can access the application with valid credentials

Scenario: TC-001 - Verify that Admin can successfully add a new user with valid data
  Given the Admin is logged into the system
  When the Admin navigates to Admin → User Management → Add User
  And the Admin fills all required fields with valid data
  And clicks Save
  Then the system should create the new user
  And the new user should appear in the user list

Scenario: TC-002 - Verify that required field validation messages appear when fields are left empty
Given the Admin is login into the system 
And the Admin is on the  Add User page 
When the Admin clicks save  without  filling in the required fields
Then validation error messages  should  appear below each empty required

Scenario: TC-003 - Verify that system shows error when Password and Confirm Password do not match
Given the Admin is logged in into the system 
And the Admin is on  the  Add user  Page 
When the  Admin  enters  the  password  
And enters  a different  value  in confirm  Password 
Then  the  system  should display  an  error  message  indicating that password do  not  match  


Scenario: TC-004 - Verify that system prevents adding a user with an existing username
  Given the Admin is logged into the system
  And a user with the same username already exists
  When the Admin navigates to Add User page
  And fills valid data but uses the existing username
  And clicks Save
  Then the system should display an error message saying "Username already exists"
